* Caffe (Berkeley)
* Theano (Pascal Lamblin and Yoshua Bengio), library retired in Fall 2017
* PyTorch (Facebook)
* Sonnet (Google)
* MXNet (Amazon)
* Torch (Lua-based)
* Microsoft Cognitive Toolkit (CNTK)
* DLIB (C++ library)
* Caffe2 (Facebook)
* Chainer (Preferred Networks, Japan)
* Paddlepaddle (Baidu, China)
* DeepLearning4J (Skymind in SF); Java, can use with Apache Hadoop and Apache Spark
